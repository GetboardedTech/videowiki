              notification e-mails from VideoWiki, which inform you of actions
              (e.g. forking requests, course reviews, and course notifications)
              that have been performed on the site. Please note that in all
              cases you will continue to receive all system e-mails (e.g. those
              regarding forgotten user passwords) and legal notices (e.g.
              updates to our policies) from us.<br />
              If you do not want to receive e-mail from us, please visit the

              computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our
              systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages
              in our website are visited and by how many people. VideoWiki
              cookies do not collect personal information, and we do not combine
              information collected through cookies with other personal
              information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or
              e-mail address is
              <br />
              The 'help' portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will
              direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new
              cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a
              new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies. We recommend that you
              leave the cookies activated because cookies allow you to use some
              of VideoWiki's features. Some of our business partners, like our
              advertisers, may use cookies on our website. We have no access to,

              Because VideoWiki enables people to discover and share courses
              shared by profiles with one another, information about the people
              who use VideoWiki is an integral part of the VideoWiki experience.
              Rest assured that we neither rent nor sell your personal
              information to anyone and that we will share your personal
              information as described below.

            <ul>
              <li>
                VideoWiki Personnel: VideoWiki personnel and authorized
                consultants and/or contractors may have access to user
                information if necessary in the normal course of VideoWiki
                business.

              <li>
                Business Transfers: In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell
                assets. In these types of transactions, user information is
                typically one of the business assets that is transferred.
                Moreover, if VideoWiki, or substantially all of its assets, were
                acquired, user information would be one of the assets that is
                transferred.
              </li>
              <li>
                Protection of VideoWiki and Others: We may release personal
                information when we believe in good faith that release is
                necessary to comply with a law; to enforce or apply our Terms of
                Use and other policies; or to protect the rights, property, or
                safety of VideoWiki, our employees, our users, or others. This
                includes exchanging information with other companies and
                organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
              </li>
              <li>
                User Profile information: Information collected during
                registration and subsequent visits, such as your full name and
                location, may be displayed to other VideoWiki users in your User
                Profile. The User Profile is the area on VideoWiki where we
                allow you to tell other VideoWiki users about yourself. You may
                control what personal information is displayed in your User

              </li>
              <li>
                Followers' Activity: Much like other online social networks,

              </li>

                finished using a shared computer.
